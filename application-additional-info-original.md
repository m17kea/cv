# Additional Information (Original Draft)

What I want to convey is that the reason I want to work for them is because I've fallen in love with coding all over again. The use of codex has enabled me to get my ideas out so fast that it's completely unblocked my creativity. I have more ideas for product improvements than I've ever had. I've solved so many problems at work that there's really not much of material value left to do without tearing it up and starting again. All of my recent creative flourishes have been about the developer workflow itself. I have been researching ways of increasing my parallel productivity using the tools with worktrees and then all of sudden the codex app was realesed ebodying all of my ideas. I'm now using this to generate another step change in my productivity levels. The ability to navigate so many parallel threads with ease is just so liberating. I now realise I want to work for the team that put these tools in my hands so I can help shape the future of developers lives everywhere. I want everyone to experience the love of coding again and unlock their creativity by promoting and improving these tools. I just can't think of anything else I'd rather work on. I'm keen to see what the teams thoughts on openclaw are and how elements of this might be adopted but in a much safer way such that these tools can be put into devlopers hands more safely where open ai can deliver this without letting naive users become comprimised by their own mistakes.
