# Recruiter Feedback and Traceability

## Original Feedback (Summary)

1. Replace the dated/generic "About" with a concise, high-impact Value Proposition.
2. Re-align the most recent title to reflect product + engineering ownership.
3. Refocus Experience on impact, not task inventory.
4. Add quantifiable Derivitec metrics:
   - Number of clients/users
   - Scale of calculations
   - Cloud estate size
   - Deployment frequency
5. Condense the CV ("less is more"), targeting one page, two at most.

## Current Status

- [x] Value Proposition section implemented with concise bullets.
- [x] Latest role reframed as product + engineering ownership.

  - 120 vCPU / 400 GB baseline to 1,500 vCPU / 6 TB peak
  - 24/7 human-gated deployments within about one hour of code push
  - 50%+ AWS cost reduction versus original Windows + MS SQL stack
