# OpenAI Codex Product Manager Role Spec

## About the Team

With Codex we’re building an AI software engineer. One that you can pair with, delegate to, or even ask to take on future tasks proactively. Our team is a fast-moving group within OpenAI, bringing together research, engineering, design, and product. We iteratively build the Codex agent harness and product to get the most out of the model, and we iteratively train the model to be great in the Codex.

## About the Role

As the product manager on Codex, you will lead the development of a highly technical product designed for a technical audience. Much of the work is 0–1, requiring you to shape product direction amid ambiguity and shape what the future of agents will look like. You’ll partner closely with world-class engineers and researchers to bring cutting-edge capabilities into the hands of developers, and you’ll shape how our AI tools support software development workflows.

This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In this role, you will:

- Shape product strategy for Codex, from early concepts through launch and iteration.
- Collaborate with engineering and research to translate breakthroughs into usable, high-value developer experiences.
- Deeply understand developer workflows and identify opportunities where AI can make them faster, more intuitive, and more powerful.
- Navigate ambiguity and make thoughtful trade-offs in 0–1 product environments.
- Partner with cross-functional teams to deliver quickly while maintaining a high bar for technical quality and user experience.

You might thrive in this role if you:

- Bring a strong technical background and have recently shipped code to production
- Have a deep intuition for developer workflows and a passion for building tools that make coding more productive and enjoyable.
- Can define product direction in ambiguous, 0–1 environments and rally teams around it.
- Demonstrate strong product intuition, making thoughtful prioritization and sequencing decisions.
- Have experience driving execution across engineering, design, and research.
- Bring an entrepreneurial mindset and adaptability, whether from startup or high-growth company environments.
