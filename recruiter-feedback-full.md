# Recruiter Feedback (Full Original Text)

Hello mate,

Here’s a doc with some recommendations. Hope you find it useful.

Importantly, the CVs that have impressed the best hiring managers I’ve worked with are the ones where the person has shown the ability to condense and communicate their impact/potential impact in one page (two at most). Think of your CV like a product landing page: clear value, proof, then detail.
This demonstrates that you have an ability to cut through the noise and shows efficiency and precision rather than being a list of everything you can think of or that you have ever done like most people do.

Long, exhaustive CVs are dated. The goal here isn’t to tell your whole story. It’s to help you stand out, show credibility, and secure the interview.

Good luck bud 💪🏻

## Doc: Recommendations

1. “About” feels dated and generic. Replace it with a Value Proposition using concise, punchy bullets for immediate impact and to break up the first page visual. This section should capture a hiring manager’s attention within the first few seconds.

2. Re-align the most recent job title to reflect product and engineering ownership, opening up both Product Manager and Software Engineering opportunities. (already discussed this)

3. Refocus the Experience section on impact rather than being a task inventory. Hiring managers care about what changed, what improved, and why it mattered.

4. Add quantifiable metrics to the Derivitec role to strengthen credibility (most people miss this on a CV but it is a great differentiator. Highlight your strongest indicators…
- Number of clients (demonstrates real-world adoption and product value)
- Volume of calculations (shows system scale and performance)
- Size of cloud estate (signals infrastructure complexity and ownership)
- Deployment frequency (reflects engineering maturity and delivery velocity)

These metrics help hiring managers quickly understand the scale, complexity, and effectiveness of your work. Have a think about your most meaningful metrics and put them in a way that makes your CV stand out.

## EXAMPLE REWRITE

### Value Proposition
- Product-focused engineer and leader turning ambiguous problems into shipped, scalable systems
- Experience spanning early-stage startups and larger, structured organisations
- Led platform rebuilds aligning technical execution with roadmap priorities, improving reliability, cost efficiency, and delivery speed
- Experienced AI workflow practitioner (Codex), converting unstructured information into execution-ready systems

### Experience

**Founding Engineer & Product Lead**  
Derivitec Ltd, London  
(later titled CTO as the company scaled)  
2017–Present

Joined a FinTech startup with an unstable product and unclear roadmap. Took ownership of product direction, platform architecture, delivery workflows, and stakeholder alignment, transforming an early prototype into a secure, scalable production system for real-time risk and portfolio management.

---

### Key Impact
- Supported X institutional clients across live trading and portfolio analytics workflows
- Reduced calculation latency from seconds to sub-second, improving responsiveness for real-time decision-making
- Increased deployment frequency from ad-hoc releases to weekly CI/CD-driven deployments
- Cut AWS costs by ~25% through infrastructure modernization and ARM migration

---

### Product & Technical Execution
- Partnered with stakeholders to define roadmap priorities and align delivery from discovery through production
- Built client-facing reporting and risk workflows supporting PnL and VaR use cases
- Modernized stack from Windows/.NET + SQL Server to Linux/.NET + PostgreSQL
- Implemented CI/CD, release quality gates, and automated production-derived testing
- Dockerized services and migrated to Kubernetes for elastic risk computation
- Built PnL and VaR pipelines using AWS Step Functions and S3
- Led coordinated multi-repo Intel-to-ARM migration with minimal downtime

## Final Note

If you can follow this process throughout the CV to condense it. Hiring managers rarely care about the details of what you did in roles 10+ years ago. Just a put the most impactful overview in with some technical detail and that should do it for the others. “Less is more”
