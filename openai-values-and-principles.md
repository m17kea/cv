AI must be advanced with knowledge of and respect for humanity’s full spectrum of experiences and perspectives.

## Values

These values define what we consider to be the most important things. They guide our decision-making. We believe that channeling these values is the most promising way to achieve our mission.

### Humanity first

Working at OpenAI means being part of a team that is passionate about benefitting people and society through our work. We build AI to elevate humanity.

### Act with humility

Humility reminds us to recognize the limits of our own knowledge and to remain open to new ideas, perspectives, and the possibility of being wrong. This mindset influences our iterative approach to deployment, and the reintegration of feedback into our research.

### Feel the AGI

AGI will be powerful in an unprecedented way, with potential for upside and downside. Building it requires rigor and discipline, boundless imagination, and a deep sense of responsibility. We approach research and product development with respect for the transformative technology we are helping create, and the coupled benefits, changes, and risks that come along with it.

### Ship joy

Through our research we develop products that can transform how people live their lives. Our technology reflects an internal culture of optimism for the future and stewardship of our mission.

## Operating Principles

These principles define how we work together. They are important for establishing our operating culture.

### Find a way

We believe in finding a way to do the things that matter. We give agency to individuals and teams to find an approach that works. Ideas come from anywhere, regardless of title or tenure.

### Creativity over control

We look to find creative solutions, even if sometimes imperfect, over rigidity and control. Our approach to solving problems is based on best principles (first principles and best practices).

### Update quickly

We come in with a hypothesis and are willing to change our approach as we receive new information. We seek truth and adapt knowing that flexibility is key to progress on the path to AGI.

### Intense focus

We are hard workers who are here to make an impact on the world. This intensity and resilience are pivotal to the mission, while clarity and focus enable us to make hard decisions.
