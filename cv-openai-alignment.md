# CV to OpenAI Values/Principles Alignment

## Values

### Humanity first
- `/Users/michael.armitage/Documents/dev.nosync/cv/src/data/experience.js:13`
- "Supported 400+ users across 20+ institutions, improving decision speed and confidence as real-time risk workflows scaled."

### Act with humility
- `/Users/michael.armitage/Documents/dev.nosync/cv/src/data/about.js:6`
- "Hands-on Codex practitioner using structured AI workflows with human feedback loops to improve delivery quality and reliability."

### Feel the AGI
- `/Users/michael.armitage/Documents/dev.nosync/cv/src/data/experience.js:16`
- "Replaced poorly safeguarded manual deployments with CI-driven delivery, quality controls, and human approval gates, enabling production deployment in about one hour from code push."

### Ship joy
- `/Users/michael.armitage/Documents/dev.nosync/cv/src/data/experience.js:25`
- "Implemented client-facing reporting with an infinite-scale Druid + AG Grid pivot and lazy loading, enabling responsive custom aggregation on 100k+ row institutional reports and making the product viable for larger institutions."

## Operating Principles

### Find a way
- `/Users/michael.armitage/Documents/dev.nosync/cv/src/data/experience.js:14`
- "Re-architected risk computation from a single webserver into a RabbitMQ fan-out microservice architecture with horizontal scaling, reaching a 120 vCPU / 400 GB baseline and 1,500 vCPU / 6 TB peak, while isolating client workloads."

### Creativity over control
- `/Users/michael.armitage/Documents/dev.nosync/cv/src/data/experience.js:25`
- "Implemented client-facing reporting with an infinite-scale Druid + AG Grid pivot and lazy loading, enabling responsive custom aggregation on 100k+ row institutional reports and making the product viable for larger institutions."

### Update quickly
- `/Users/michael.armitage/Documents/dev.nosync/cv/src/data/experience.js:23`
- "Led stakeholder alignment on roadmap priorities and delivery from discovery through production, iterating quickly on feedback."

### Intense focus
- `/Users/michael.armitage/Documents/dev.nosync/cv/src/data/experience.js:17`
- "Delivered 50%+ AWS cost reduction via a three-stage migration: Microsoft to Linux, EC2 to EKS, then Intel to ARM."
