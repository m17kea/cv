    'I build products by turning messy problems into systems that scale, pairing technical rigor with clear product intent.',
    'As a CTO, I rebuilt platforms and workflows, aligned stakeholders on roadmap priorities, and delivered measurable gains in reliability, cost, and speed, often as a solo operator in chaotic environments.',
    'I have hit the ceiling of solo Codex adoption and want to help build the product that unlocks the next order of magnitude.',
